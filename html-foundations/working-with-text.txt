<p> (some text) </p> -> paragraph text 

headers tag
<h1> (some text) </h1> -> largest heading
<h6> (some text) </h6> -> smallest heading 

<strong> (some text) </strong> -> bolden text
<em> (some text) </em> -> indent text 

<p>
 <strong>
  Hi!
 </strong>
</p>
p -> parent
<strong> & text -> child 

css affects only the child (not grandchild of css)

<!-- --> -> comment in HTML



A metaphor (directly copy and pasted from TOP)
Absolute and relative links are a tricky concept to build a good mental model of, a metaphor may help:

Think of your domain name (town.com) as a town, the directory in which your website is located (/museum) as a museum, and each page on your website as a room in the museum (/museum/movie_room.html and /museum/shops/coffee_shop.html). Relative links like ./shops/coffee_shop.html are directions from the current room (the museum movie room /museum/movie_room.html) to another room (the museum shop). Absolute links, on the other hand, are full directions including the protocol (https), domain name (town.com) and the path from that domain name (/museum/shops/coffee_shop.html): https://town.com/museum/shops/coffee_shop.html.


IMAGES

To display an image in HTML use void element <img>

use src to link to that image (absolue and relative accepted)

Parent directories -> ../

Alt -> use to describe an image for screenwrites or in case the image fails to load

image size atrributes ->   changes height and width of image directly (good practice add even with CSS)

<img src="https://www.theodinproject.com/mstile-310x310.png" alt="The Odin Project Logo" height="310" width="310">
