html boilerplate

<!DOCTYPE html> tells computer which version of html to use -> HTML5 

<html>
</html> -> tag encloses all the html code

<html lang = "en">
</html> -> lang is responsible for indicating the language of the webpage is in English (important for screen readers to translate)

<head>
</head> -> important for meta-information (not the place for html)


<title>My First Webpage</title> -> titles webpage 

<body>
</body> -> where actual HTML elements go into 

<meta charset="UTF-8"> -> allows page to process special characters and regular characters
