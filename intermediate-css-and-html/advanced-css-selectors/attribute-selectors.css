/*
Attribute Selectors

An attribute is anything in the opening tag of an HTML element -
such as src = 'picture.jpg' or href = 'www.theodinproject.com'

[attribute] - This general selector will select anything where the given attribute exists. Its value doesnâ€™t matter.
selector[attribute] - Optionally we can combine our attribute selectors with other types of selectors, such as class or element selectors.
[attribute="value"] - To get really specific, we can use = to match a specific attribute with a specific value.


  [src] {
    This will target any element that has a src attribute.
  }

  img[src] {
    This will only target img elements that have a src attribute.
  }

  img[src="puppy.jpg"] {
    This will target img elements with a src attribute that is exactly "puppy.jpg"
  }
*/
