/*
Absolute units are those that remain the same in any contenxt. (Example: px)
*/

/*
Relative units change based on their context

em and rem are based on their font size

1em is  font-size of an element (or the element's parent if you are using the element's parent to set the font size)

(if an element's font size is 16px, then setting its width to 4em makes it width 64px (16 x 4 = 64)

Its based of the font size

rem is based on the root element, and is recommmended, as it allows to respect the user wishes of font readability
