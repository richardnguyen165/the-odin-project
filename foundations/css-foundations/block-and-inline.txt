By default, block elements will appear on the page stacked on atop of each other, each starting on a new line.

Inline block appear in line with whatever elements they are placed beside. Do not add padding or margin for inline lements, it bhaves differently.

Divand spans are "hook" elements, where we can give them ids to style them. (customized elements)

Divs are block elements, spans are in-block elements.

Divs aere contaners elements used to store elements, and divide the page into "blocks"

Span are mainly used to group texr context and inline HTML elements for style and should only be used when no other semantic HTML element is appropriate.


Normal flow

A block element fills the entire inline space of a parent elment by default, growing by the parent's length

to set in-block or block, use display:block or display: in-block in CSS

Inline elements sit on the same line as long as there is space


display inline -> width and height are not respeceted, overlap


display: inline-block
Here the width, height and padding are respected, but the two copies of the element can still sit side by side.

display: block
Here again everything is respected, but the elements donâ€™t sit side by side.
