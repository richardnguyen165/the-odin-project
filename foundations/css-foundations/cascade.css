/*
in terms of rules there are a few to follow (which rules are applied)
helps reason as to why (why is my box red instead of blue?

lowest to highest in terms of specific: 

1. ID selectors (most specific selector)
2. Class selectors
3. Type selectors (least specific)

if two elements are the same, whichever one has more of the selectors wins

otherwise, no matter how many selectors of one class, if there is even one above, that above one wins
(5 class selectors < 1 id selector)

in some cases, if there is no specificity winning, whichever one is the lowest wins

NOTE:

When comparing selectors, you may come across special symbols for the universal selector (*) as well as combinators (+, ~, >, and an empty space). These symbols do not add any specificity in and of themselves.

/* Example one: rule 2 wins because it has more class selectors*/

/* rule 1 */
.subsection {
  color: blue;

/* rule 2 */

/* Example two: rule 2 wins becayse it has an ID selector*/

/* rule 1 */
#subsection {
  color: blue;
}

/* rule 2 */
.main .list {
  color: red;
}


/* Example three: Both have an id selector. However, because rule 2 has an additional class selector, it wins*/
/* rule 1 */
#subsection {
  background-color: yellow;
  color: blue;
}

/* rule 2 */
.main #subsection {
 color: red;

/*Example four: No one wins -> both have two class selectors, even if the first one is chained (actually rule 2 wins)*/
/* rule 1 */
.class.second-class {
  font-size: 12px;

/* rule 2 */

Inheritance

<div id="parent">
  <div class="child"></div>
</div>

Inheritance refers to certain CSS properties that, when applied to an element, are inherited by that element’s descendants, even if we don’t explicitly write a rule for those descendants.
