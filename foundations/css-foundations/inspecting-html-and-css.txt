To open up the inspector, you can right-click on any element of a webpage and click “Inspect” or press F12. Go ahead and do that right now to see the HTML and CSS used on this page.

you can click the blue-highlighted icon shown below on the left, and hover over any element on the page.

When an element is selected, the Styles tab will show all the currently applied styles, as well as any styles that are being overwritten (indicated by a strikethrough of the text). (bottom of the inspect element)

The Styles panel also allows you to edit styles directly in the browser.  (click and type)
