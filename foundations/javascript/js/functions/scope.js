// SCOPE

// The top-level outside all your functions is called the global scope

// you can use variables outside the function, in the function

// however, variables created/initialized inside the function cannot be used outside of it

/*
To quote:

It is a bit like a zoo. The lions, zebras, tigers, and penguins are kept in their own enclosures and only have access to the things inside their enclosures — in the same manner as the function scopes. If they were able to get into other enclosures, problems would occur. At best, different animals would feel really uncomfortable inside unfamiliar habitats — a lion or tiger would feel terrible inside the penguins' watery, icy domain. At worst, the lions and tigers might try to eat the penguins!

The zoo keeper is like the global scope — they have the keys to access every enclosure, restock food, tend to sick animals, etc.
