to create a link in html, use an anchor element and add an href (without it, it won't do anything):

<a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about">About The Odin Project</a>

opening links in a new tab

add taget = "_blank" this allows it to open in a new tab.


rel="noopener noreferrer" IS VERY IMPORTANT

noopener ensures that the link opened in the new window can access the previous/original page

noreferrer prevents the new page from knowing where the user came from (what page they clicked in order to get to the page they are currently on)

noopener prevents phishing attacks (tabnabbing)



TYPES OF LINKS 

Absolute Links 

Links to other websites on the internet are called absolute links. 

Syntax: scheme://domain/path

Relative Limls

Links to other pahes within our website are called relative links. Reletive links 
do not have the domain name, and it is relative to the page you are creating the page 
you are in (think of the file system)
